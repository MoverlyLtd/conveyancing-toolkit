# Conveyancing Toolkit

The open-source AI toolkit for UK residential conveyancing. Free forever.

Built and maintained by [Moverly](https://moverly.com). Open to contributions from everyone.

---

## What this is

A collection of AI-ready tools that give conveyancers, estate agents, and property professionals instant access to structured property intelligence through Claude, OpenClaw, or any AI platform that supports the Model Context Protocol.

Every tool in this toolkit is **free, open source, and MIT-licensed**. The standalone tools work without any account or API key. The Moverly-connected tools require a Moverly API token for live transaction intelligence.

We believe the conveyancing profession deserves better tools. We're building them in the open and we want your help.

## Tools

### Standalone — works immediately, no setup

| **SDLT Calculator** | Stamp Duty Land Tax — standard, first-time buyer, additional property, non-UK resident. Deterministic bash script, no LLM maths. |

## Our promise

This toolkit will always be free and open source. Better tools for conveyancers benefits everyone — including us.

## About

The toolkit is built on the [Property Data Trust Framework (PDTF)](https://github.com/property-data-standards-co/schemas) — the UK's emerging standard for structured property data, already carrying thousands of transactions through the National Property Transaction Network (NPTN).

Moverly's Diligence Engine provides the intelligence layer — a deterministic rule engine that evaluates property risk across 37 categories, producing consistent, auditable results with full evidence provenance. Not an LLM. Not probabilistic. Every scenario has defined inputs, conditions, and outputs.
