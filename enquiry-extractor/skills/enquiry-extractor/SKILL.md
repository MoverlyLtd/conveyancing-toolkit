# Enquiry Extractor

Parse inbound enquiry emails and route each enquiry to the correct PDTF path in Moverly.

## Response Rules — Always Include

**DO:**
- Parse the email text to extract **each individual enquiry** as a separate item
- For each enquiry, determine the **PDTF path** it relates to using the schema skeleton (see pdtf-path-resolver skill or `{{SKILL_DIR}}/references/schema-skeleton.md`)
- Present the extracted enquiries in a numbered table: number, enquiry text, proposed PDTF path, confidence
- **Ask the user to confirm** the path mappings before pushing to MCP — path resolution is a best-effort match
- When pushing via MCP, use `raise_enquiry` with the enquiry text and resolved `pdtfPath`
- If the email contains a participant name/firm, extract that for the `from` field
- Preserve the original enquiry wording — don't paraphrase

**DON'T:**
- Don't push enquiries without user confirmation of the path mappings
- Don't merge multiple enquiries into one — each numbered point is a separate enquiry
- Don't strip context that makes the enquiry meaningful (e.g. "further to our search results" is useful context)
- Don't invent responses — this skill is for *receiving and logging* enquiries, not answering them

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse the Email

User pastes email text. Extract:
- **Sender details:** firm name, conveyancer name, reference number
- **Individual enquiries:** split on numbering, bullet points, or clear topic boundaries
- **Context:** any preamble that applies to all enquiries (e.g. "with reference to the title register...")

### Step 2: Map to PDTF Paths

For each enquiry, determine the most relevant PDTF path. Common mappings:

| Enquiry Subject | PDTF Path |
|----------------|-----------|
| Lease/ground rent | `/propertyPack/ownership/ownershipsToBeTransferred` |
| Building works/alterations | `/propertyPack/alterationsAndChanges/*` |
| Planning permission | `/propertyPack/alterationsAndChanges/planningPermissionBreaches` |
| Boundaries | `/propertyPack/legalBoundaries` |
| Flooding | `/propertyPack/environmentalIssues/flooding` |
| Title restrictions | `/propertyPack/titlesToBeSold` |
| Rights of way | `/propertyPack/rightsAndInformalArrangements` |
| Drainage/services | `/propertyPack/waterAndDrainage` |
| Occupiers | `/propertyPack/occupiers` |
| Covenants | `/propertyPack/titlesToBeSold` |

If unsure, mark as "needs manual mapping" and suggest the user check with `describe_form_path`.

### Step 3: Confirm with User

Present:
```
Extracted 8 enquiries from Smith & Jones (ref: SJ/2024/1234):

 #  Enquiry                                          Path                                    Confidence
 1  "Please confirm the remaining lease term..."     /propertyPack/ownership/...              High
 2  "Was planning permission obtained for the..."    /propertyPack/alterationsAndChanges/...   High  
 3  "We note a restriction on the title..."          /propertyPack/titlesToBeSold              High
 4  "Please clarify the drainage arrangements..."    /propertyPack/waterAndDrainage/drainage   Medium
 ...

Shall I push these to the transaction? (I'll use raise_enquiry for each)
```

### Step 4: Push to MCP

On confirmation:
```
Call: raise_enquiry(transactionId, message, pdtfPath, from) × N
```

Report: "8 enquiries logged. The seller's conveyancer will see these in their transaction."
