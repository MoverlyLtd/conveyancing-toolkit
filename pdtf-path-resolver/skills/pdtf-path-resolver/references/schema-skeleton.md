# PDTF Schema Skeleton — Path Resolution Reference

Use this to map natural language subjects to PDTF paths. All paths are under the transaction root.

## Key Concept: Attachment Paths

Many schema nodes have an `attachments` property for uploading documents directly to the relevant data point. When resolving a document upload, always target the most specific `attachments` path — e.g. a building regs certificate for a loft conversion goes to:
`/propertyPack/alterationsAndChanges/loftConversion/buildingRegApproval/attachments`
NOT `/propertyPack/alterationsAndChanges/loftConversion` or `/propertyPack/documents`.

---

## Title & Ownership
- `/propertyPack/titlesToBeSold` — title registers, title numbers, proprietors, charges, restrictions, covenants
- `/propertyPack/ownership` — sellers count, mortgage, help-to-buy, first registration, limited company

## Alterations & Building Works
Base: `/propertyPack/alterationsAndChanges/`

Each alteration type has a consistent pattern with sub-paths for documents, planning, building regs, listed building consent, and deed restriction consent — each with their own `attachments`:

| Alteration | Base Path | Has `documents` | Has `planningPermission/attachments` | Has `buildingRegApproval/attachments` | Has `listedBuildingConsent/attachments` | Has `deedRestrictionConsent/attachments` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hasStructuralAlterations` | `.../hasStructuralAlterations/` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `changeOfUse` | `.../changeOfUse/` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `nonResidentialPurposes` | `.../nonResidentialPurposes/` | ❌ (has top-level `attachments`) | — | — | — | — |
| `windowReplacementsSince2002` | `.../windowReplacementsSince2002/` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `extension` | `.../extension/` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `hasAddedConservatory` | `.../hasAddedConservatory/` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
