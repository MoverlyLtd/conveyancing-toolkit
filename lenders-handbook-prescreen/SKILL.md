# Lender's Handbook Pre-Screen

## Response Rules — Always Include

**DO:**
- Always give **specific minimum lease lengths per lender** when asked about lease eligibility — don't round or approximate. Key thresholds: Halifax 70 years, Nationwide 55 years (unique — lowest major lender), Barclays 70 years, Santander 55 years
- When discussing building regulations: always mention the **enforcement timeline thresholds** — 4-year rule for building work (after which enforcement action is time-barred) and 10-year rule for other planning breaches
- Always mention **indemnity insurance** as a potential resolution option for building regulations issues
- Always provide a **clear yes/no eligibility answer** per lender, not just threshold numbers — e.g. "Halifax: YES — 72 years exceeds their 70-year minimum"
- Cite **Part 2** as the source for lender-specific requirements and **Part 1** for general requirements (with section numbers: 5.14 leasehold, 5.5 building regs)

**DON'T:**
- Don't state generic "most lenders require 70+ years" without naming specific lenders and their actual thresholds
- Don't say Nationwide requires 70 or 85 years — it's 55 years (one of the most permissive major lenders for lease length)
- Don't discuss building regulations without mentioning the enforcement period and indemnity insurance option

Exhaustive checklist covering every Part 1 requirement of the UK Finance
Mortgage Lenders' Handbook for residential transactions in England & Wales.

## Quick Start

1. Read the full checklist: `references/part1-checks.md`
   — 24 categories, 90+ checks, every Part 1 requirement
2. When a check says "check Part 2": read `references/lenders/{slug}.md`
   for the specific lender's requirements (~108 Q&A per lender)
3. Follow the reporting decision tree below for any issue found

## Important Rules

- Part 1 = general requirements for ALL lenders
- Part 2 = lender-specific overrides and thresholds
- Express requirements in plain language — cite handbook section numbers
- When in doubt: REPORT to lender before completion (HB 2.3)
- Do NOT complete until written instructions received after reporting

## The Golden Rule

> If you believe any matter should reasonably be considered important by
> the lender in deciding whether to lend, and you cannot disclose it due
> to conflict of interest, you must cease acting and return instructions
> (HB 5.3.1).

## Reporting Decision Tree

When you identify any issue:

```
Can you certify title as good and marketable?
├── YES → Proceed without referral
│   └── Exception: some items ALWAYS require reporting regardless
│       (purchase price discrepancy, sub-6-month ownership,
│        non-owner seller, cashback/incentives, letting, HMO)
├── NO → Can indemnity insurance resolve it?
│   ├── YES → Arrange insurance (check Part 2 for acceptance)
│   │   └── You can now certify → Proceed
│   └── NO → Report to lender (HB 2.3) BEFORE exchange
│       ├── Identify relevant handbook provision
│       ├── Summarise legal risks
│       ├── Recommend how lender should protect interest
│       └── DO NOT COMPLETE until written instructions received
└── CONFLICT OF INTEREST prevents disclosure?
    └── CEASE ACTING → Return instructions (HB 5.3.1)
```

## Part 2: Lender-Specific Requirements

When a "check Part 2" item is triggered, read the specific lender's
reference file from `references/lenders_json/{lender-slug}.json`.

Each file contains the lender's factual answers to every Part 2 question
(~108 items) structured as JSON.

**To look up a lender's Part 2 requirement:**
1. Identify the section number from the Part 1 checklist (e.g. 5.14.1)
2. Read `references/lenders_json/{lender-slug}.json`
3. Find the matching section number in the JSON object
4. Apply the lender's specific factual requirements

**Tier 1 lenders** (~80% of UK mortgages):
nationwide-building-society, santander-uk-plc, barclays-bank-uk-plc,
hsbc-uk-bank-plc, national-westminster-bank-plc, halifax,
bank-of-scotland-beginning-a, tsb-bank-plc, virgin-money,
yorkshire-building-society, skipton-building-society,
coventry-building-society, leeds-building-society,
principality-building-society, metro-bank-plc

Plus 50+ Tier 2 and Tier 3 lenders in the same directory.

If the borrower's lender is not listed, fall back to Part 1 general
requirements and advise the conveyancer to check the UK Finance website
directly for that lender's Part 2.
