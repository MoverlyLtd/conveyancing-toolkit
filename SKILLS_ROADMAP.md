## Governance & guardrail skills 🛡️

Most skills here add **domain knowledge**. A second category adds **safety**: guardrail skills that check *how* the model is being used rather than answering a topic. Two are in draft:

| Skill | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Data-protection guard | Guardrail | Pre-flight PII / GDPR check that coaches (rather than punishes) when sensitive client data is about to be entered. It must *not* flag public-register data — proprietor names, price paid, a registered lease — only the client's own personal or financial details. |
| Safe-AI gate | Guardrail | Labels each answer by how it was produced — a validated tool, a cited source, or general model knowledge — and warns when a question would be better served by a validated skill. |

Guardrails are scored differently from advisory skills: on **precision/recall** over a labelled set that deliberately includes *negatives* (e.g. a title full of owner names that must not trip the guard), not on a single right answer. One honest caveat: a skill only runs when the host invokes it, so reliable always-on enforcement depends on the environment running it — an unenforced guardrail is a helpful coach, not a compliance control.

Contributions and test cases welcome.
