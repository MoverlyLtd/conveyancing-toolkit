## Ideas / Backlog 💡

- Conveyancing quiz / training skill (test knowledge of process)
- AML/IDV checklist
- Chain management tracker
- Contract review assistant (flag unusual clauses)
- Stamp duty for Scotland (LBTT) and Wales (LTT)
- Commercial property SDLT (different rates)
- Ground rent analyser (escalation clauses, peppercorn conversion)

## Design Principles

1. **Deterministic over probabilistic** — if there's a calculation, write a script
2. **Standalone first** — build trust without requiring a Moverly account
3. **Agent-native** — write for AI agents, not human developers
4. **Accurate and sourced** — cite legislation, effective dates, official sources
5. **Self-contained** — no external dependencies beyond standard shell tools
